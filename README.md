## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  See all countries from the API on the homepage
-  Search for a country using an `input` field
-  Filter countries by region
-  Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
-  Click through to the border countries on the detail page
-  Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

   color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log('ðŸŽ‰')

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

-  [Kevin Powell - Custom Select Menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB14uo0Tu5A&t=183s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This helped me style the dropdown menu to allow users to filter the countries displayed, since I had never styled a select menu before this project. It was a great resource to learn how to hide the default arrow which is pinned to the edge of the menu, and how to create a more appealing one with pseudo elements using a border trick to create a triangle.

###### TODO

HTML:

CSS:

JS:

API fetching -

Props.children - multiple pages

Border trick to create a triangle - point-events: none;

`Styles:`

Input search - issues with showing live results (input event while typing - not searching until typing 1 one more time post fully country name entered) | reverting to submit btn for validation + searching once input complete

Controlling imgs in grid items - diff sizes

Diff filtering logic (diff versions of state) - done stylistically with todo list

Create page effect - state to conditionally render diff components (doing so in sep funcs)

useMemo() + useLayoutEffect()

Typescript advanced-basics - exporting interfaces (+ storing elsewhere for DRY code) | type vs interface (destructuring context bug) | fixing any types for params in funcs (especially arr iteration methods) | typeof operator for type (dynamic) |
